#Project Overview

1 Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to put in practice the content learned during the "Javascript and the DOM" section of the Front-end developer Nanodegree by [Udacity](www.udacity.com).

The project helps combining together all the notions that were learned during the course in a single landing page.

2 Project functionalities

In order to pass the review, the landing page needs to have the following functionalities added:

* Navigation menu built dynamically with Javascript manipulating the DOM; new links are added to the navigation bar as new items are added to the page;
* Section Active State function in order to make clear which section is being currently viewed;
* Scroll to Anchor functionality in order to have the page scroll to the appropriate section when a menu link is clicked
